# Chip-8 Emulator Configuration Example
# Copy this file and modify it to customize your emulator settings
# Usage: chip8 --config example-config.toml roms/your-game.ch8

[behavior]
# CPU execution speed in instructions per second (100-2000)
# Classic CHIP-8: 500 Hz, Modern: 700 Hz
cpu_speed = 700

# Enable memory wraparound (classic CHIP-8 behavior)
# When true, out-of-bounds memory access wraps around at 4KB boundary
# When false, out-of-bounds access causes an error
memory_wraparound = false

# Enable strict bounds checking
# When true, catches programming errors with detailed messages
# When false, permits some out-of-bounds access
strict_bounds = true

# Timer update frequency in Hz (typically 60 Hz)
timer_frequency = 60

[graphics]
# Display scale factor (1-20)
# Higher values = larger window
scale_factor = 12

# Foreground color (RGBA values 0-255)
# Default: Green { r = 0, g = 255, b = 0, a = 255 }
foreground_color = { r = 0, g = 255, b = 0, a = 255 }

# Background color (RGBA values 0-255)
# Default: Black { r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, a = 255 }
background_color = { r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, a = 255 }

# Enable smooth scaling (vs. nearest-neighbor)
# true = smoother but slightly blurry
# false = sharp pixels, more authentic retro look
smooth_scaling = true

# Maintain 2:1 aspect ratio (CHIP-8 is 64x32)
maintain_aspect_ratio = true

[audio]
# Buzzer frequency in Hz (typical range: 220-880)
# Common values: 440 (A4), 523 (C5), 800 (higher beep)
frequency = 440.0

# Volume level (0.0 = silent, 1.0 = maximum)
# Recommended: 0.3-0.5 to avoid ear fatigue
volume = 0.3

# Waveform type: "Sine", "Square", "Sawtooth", or "Triangle"
# Square = classic beep sound
# Sine = smoother, less harsh
# Sawtooth = buzzy, retro
# Triangle = mellow
waveform = "Square"

# Audio sample rate in Hz (typically 44100 or 48000)
sample_rate = 44100

# Audio buffer size in samples
# Lower = less latency but more CPU usage
# Higher = more latency but smoother playback
buffer_size = 512

[keyboard]
# Enable keyboard input capture
capture_enabled = true

# Keyboard polling rate in Hz (1-1000)
# Higher = more responsive but more CPU usage
# Desktop: 60 Hz, Gaming: 120 Hz
polling_rate = 60

# Handle key repeat events
# true = holding a key sends multiple press events
# false = holding a key sends only one press event
handle_repeats = true

# Key repeat delay in milliseconds
repeat_delay = 250

# Use raw input mode (bypasses OS key repeat)
use_raw_input = false

[debug]
# Enable debug mode
# Shows additional diagnostic information
enabled = false

# Break execution on error
# When true, emulator pauses when an error occurs
break_on_error = false

# Log each instruction execution
# Warning: Very verbose, slows down emulation significantly
log_instructions = false
